        <p>Hi! I'm Lightbug, welcome to my web page. Here you'll find all the information related to all the Unity assets i create, from documentation, external resources and links, descriptions, features, etc. Hopefully this site will serve as a hub, so everything you'll need is here.</p>

<h1>Important information</h1>

<h3>Refunds</h3>

<p>Even if Unity says "We've got you covered", i still have the final word (this is the same for any asset on the store). I will authorize a refund for you only if <strong>the asset advertises something that it is not</strong>, for example, if some feature is not there, or doesn't even work (mistakes happen). If that's the case, then you can send me an email and ask for a refund, no problem at all.</p>

<p>That being said, assets on the Unity asset store (at least mine) do not follow a "try before buy" policy. Once you clicked the buy button there is no going back, so please make sure you are buying the asset you want. That's why i'm open for questions 24/7, i can give you code examples, show you videos/gifs, whatever you need to make sure you're purchasing the asset you need for your project.</p>


<h3>Support</h3>

<p>Once you buy any asset you will received free support. Please when asking for something try to be very clear and organized, indicate your version of the asset and your Unity editor.</p>

<p>Regarding support, questions about the last version of an asset will have a higher priority. So, if your asset version is old, and your asking me about an issue that has been fixed already, then i would encourage you to update. If that's not an option i can still help you of course (sometimes developers need to stick with a particular version, and that's fine).</p>

<h3>Readme files</h3>

<p>A common problem is that users tend to ignore any readme file included with the asset, especially when there is demo content involved. Please, before asking for support, or going in rant mode to leave a bad review on the asset store, take a breath and read the readme file. I tend to put a "OPEN ME" folder with a "README" text file. Don't worry, it won't make you lose your whole day, only half a minute.</p>

<h3>Editor support</h3>

<p>Never purchase some asset assuming it will work with an unofficial version of Unity. If you still want to use some of my assets with an older version of Unity, ask first! Otherwise i won't give you any support.</p>

<p>What if Unity 20XY.Z comes out tomorrow, you import the asset and something doesn't work, or a console error appears, or something unusual happens. Well, first don't freak out, that could happen, especially since Unity is "evolving" year after year. If this happens to you the best thing you can do is to send me an email describing your situation.</p>

<h3>Assets version</h3>

<p>Normally i keep specific versions of all my assets</p>

<p>
Yes! I keep a backup with all the released versions of CCP. For me to send you the required version I will need your invoice number first (no exception).
</p>

<h3>I downloaded the last version of Unity, and your asset doesn't work with it. Could you please do something about it?</h3>

<p>
Of course! before you go and write a 1 star review please let me know about your specific problem (include all the related errors/warnings in the message). Unity is adding and deprecating stuff like crazy, if something doesn't work with the new stuff let me know about it and i will fix it. It will help you, me and others.
That said, I always test my assets on new <strong>official versions</strong> of the Unity editor, just to be 100% sure.
