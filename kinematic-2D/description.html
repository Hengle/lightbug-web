        <p>Kinematic 2D is a fully Kinematic (non-physics based) 2D Character controller solution that allows you to do the movement of your 2D character while handling collisions.
            
        <ul>            
            <li>It offers the functionalities the default Unity Character Controller offers and many more (steps and slopes handling, ground alignment, ground clamping, etc).</li>
            <li>It was designed only for two dimensional movement (2D).
            <li>The collision detection method works with 2D and 3D colliders.
            <li>The character body shape is a box (instead of a capsule, this is great for platformers).
            <li>Fixed time step (it uses FixedUpdate).
            <li>Smooth interpolated movement.
            <li>Really good performance, (tested in desktop with 500 2D interpolated moving characters, resulting in >300 fps without Vsync). 

        </ul>
